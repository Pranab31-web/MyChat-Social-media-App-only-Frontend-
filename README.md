Hey there, this is a frontend based on react of a social media app. I have designed this while learning react.

If you want to run the website,
1. Unzip all the zip folders provided
2. Keep those folders and all the other files in same folder
3. open the terminal on that folder
4. Type 'npm run dev'
5. Click on the localhost it generated on your pc.
You are good to go.

Please suggest any feedbacks if you have.
